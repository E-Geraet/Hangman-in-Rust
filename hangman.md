# Overview

I created this Hangman game to learn more about Rust. The goal was to practice working with Rust's features like memory management, variables, and syntax. This project helped me get comfortable using Rust for making small interactive programs.

The game lets the player guess a word letter by letter. It uses a random word from a list, keeps track of wrong guesses, and shows a hangman figure as the player loses attempts. This project helped me understand how to work with structs, loops, conditionals, and user input in Rust.

# Development Environment

Here are the tools I used to create the game:

- Rust: The programming language used for this project.
- Cargo: A tool that helps with building and managing Rust projects.
- Visual Studio Code: The text editor I used to write and run the code.

I also used the `rand` crate to pick a random word and `std::io` to handle user input.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Add more hangman stages and different difficulty levels.
- Let players choose the type of words to guess (like animals or tech terms).
- Make input checks clearer and improve the game-over messages.
- Optimize how the game stores and checks guessed letters.
